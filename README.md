What is "Open Apexx"?
---------------------
apexx is a CMS written in PHP, which was originally created and distributed by Christian Scheb on http://www.stylemotion.de as a commercial software. Nearly 8 years after the first release the end of development has come and he decided to publish it under an open source license.

The CMS is suitable for a wide range of website, e.g. a simple company page or a website for your club. The main focus is on websites driven by editorial content with a community around it.

The system is only available in German language, but has support for localization.
